        I'm Rashadul Haque, a passionate developer from Sweden. With a focus on
        learning and continuous improvement, I have experience in both frontend
        and backend development. I enjoy working with technologies like React,
        TypeScript, and Next.js to create dynamic and interactive user
        interfaces. On the backend, I explore Node.js and PHP, leveraging
        frameworks such as Express.js and Laravel. By combining these skills, I
        strive to build efficient and reliable web applications. Let's
        collaborate and bring your ideas to reality with modern and innovative
        solutions.
